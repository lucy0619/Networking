packages: tidyverse - manipulating data to be edge list and node list
          network - Construct, coerce to, test for and print network objects. Using plot() to plot network objects.
          igraph - Construct igraph objects. Using plot() to plot igraph objects.
          better to use network and igraph in a seperate environment, otherwise they might interfere with each other.

          -visNetwork
          -networkD3


-An adjacency matrix is a square matrix in which the column and row names are the nodes of the network. 
 Within the matrix a 1 indicates that there is a connection between the nodes, and a 0 indicates no connection. 
e.g    1 2 3 
     1 0 1 1 
     2 1 0 0 
     
 Relationship: from 1 to 2, from 1 to 3, from 2 to 1.

-Edge list: source target attribute(weight)
  from  to
   1     2
   1     3
   2     1
-Node list
   Node
   1
   2

-Directed network: the distinction between source and target is meaningful.
 If the edges have a magnitude attribute the graph is considered weighted.
 
-default plot()
 generating plot base on edge list and the shape of plot is random. Repeating running plot() function n times may 
 probably gets n different shape.

-interactive network graph
 "visNetwork" seems to be a easier way to draw a simple network graph 
 visNetwork(node tibble/dataframe, edge tibble/dataframe)
