-An adjacency matrix is a square matrix in which the column and row names are the nodes of the network. 
 Within the matrix a 1 indicates that there is a connection between the nodes, and a 0 indicates no connection. 
e.g    1 2 3 
     1 0 1 1 
     2 1 0 0 
     
 Relationship: from 1 to 2, from 1 to 3, from 2 to 1.

-Edge list: source target attribute(weight)
  from  to
   1     2
   1     3
   2     1
-Node list
   Node
   1
   2



-Directed network: the distinction between source and target is meaningful.
 If the edges have a magnitude attribute the graph is considered weighted.
